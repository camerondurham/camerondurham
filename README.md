# hi there, i'm cam

- I graduated from [USC Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) in Computer Science 
- I work as an SDE at Amazon on listing platform data ingestion and precompute.
- My pronouns are [they/them/theirs](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves) and [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he/.../himself). 
- I'm learning `.rs`, `.go`, and `.ts` but will always like `.cpp`
- Currently I develop and maintain a Docker environment manager [ch](https://github.com/camerondurham/ch) written in Go. It's a general purpose tool for using containers to compile and debug code used in USC's DS & A course, [CSCI 104](https://bytes.usc.edu/cs104/): [csci104/docker](https://github.com/csci104/docker)
