### hi there, i'm cam

I graduated from [USC Viterbi ✌️](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) in May '21! Currently, I'm a software engineer for Amazon and work on distributed data ingestion powering the Seller Central website. My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he/.../himself) and [they/them/theirs](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves). 
I maintain a [Docker](https://docker.com) environment manager written in [Go](https://golang.org/) that was partially made for USC's data structures and algorithms course,
[CSCI 104](https://github.com/csci104/docker).

I'm learning [Rust](https://rustlang.org) and want to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) but will always have a soft spot for C++.

You can check out my website at [cmrn.xyz](https://cmrn.xyz)/[u64.cam](http://u64.cam), hosted on my Raspberry Pi.
