### hi there ✌, i'm cam

I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Southern California. My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he/.../himself) or [they/them/theirs](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves).
I'm actively maintaining a Docker environment manager written in Golang. I'm learning Rust and want to learn Zig but will
always have a soft spot for C++.

You can check out my website at [cmrn.xyz](https://cmrn.xyz), hosted on my Raspberry Pi.
