### hi there, i'm cam

I graduated from [USC Viterbi ✌️](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) in May '21 and now a SDE at Amazon. My pronouns are [they/them/theirs](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves) and [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he/.../himself) . 
I maintain a Docker environment manager ([ch](https://github.com/camerondurham/ch)) written in [Go](https://golang.org/) that was partially made for USC's data structures and algorithms course, CSCI 104:
[csci104/docker](https://github.com/csci104/docker). I'm learning [Rust](https://rustlang.org) and want to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) but will always like C++.

My recent projects are hosted here on gh or listed here: [u64.cam/projects](https://u64.cam/projects.html)
